Description of the Problem
Sometimes users get lost within a website, and end up purchasing the wrong product, or spending more than necessary.
When comparing products, users usually have to go to different websites to review different products.
After finding a deal on a third party website, the user might not have the same assurance to buy the product compared to the official website of the product.
